streamable: true 

var t = new TrackCollection()

functions themselves have methods - call and apply also bind

You can bind a context to a function... will return a copy of that function 

bind


var a = function(){
	console.log(this);<-- this will refer to the obj foo bar
};
a();
//window

var b = a.bind({foo: "bar"});
b()
//{foo: "bar"}

a.bind(foo);
returns a new copy of that function but the this will always refer to that

use it only if youre not going to use that funciton anywhere else
use

//creates a copy of that anonymous function with the context bound to this.



//
var tracks = new TrackCollection();
tracks.loadGenre("rock");
tracks.first().get("title");


tracks.last().play();

tracks.first().id

tracks.search("chevelle")
tracks.last().play();
tracks.last().pause();
//

var tracks = new TrackCollection()
tracks.search("black keys")
var view = new TrackView({model: tracks.first(), el: "body"});
view.render();
tracks.first().toJSON();





tracks = new TrackCollection()
tracks.search("black keys")
var view = new TrackView({collection: tracks});
$("body").append(view.render().el);
